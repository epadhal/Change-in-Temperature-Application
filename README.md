# Change-in-Temperature-Application
The rate of change in the temperature of an object, 𝑑T/dt , is directly proportional to the difference between its temperature, T, and the ambient temperature, T 0
Given a constant of proportionality, k, of 0.1 s -1 and an ambient temperature of 20 ̊C, graph the temperature of the
object over the first 50 seconds for each of the following initial temperatures (all on the same graph):
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 ̊C
# Rc Circuit Application 
Where RC is the product of the resistance and the capacitance and V a is the applied voltage.
Suppose that RC=0.2, the applied voltage is 10 V, and the initial voltage on the capacitor is 2 V
Report the voltage after: 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 seconds (give values to 2 decimal places)
How long does it take for the voltage to reach 8.0 Volts? (give answer to 2 decimal places)
Plot the voltage V(t) for the first one second. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 10 V. Include
a grid, title, and axis labels
# Temperature Application
The equation for the temperature T of a certain object immersed in a liquid bath of constant temperature, Tb, is
10 𝑑T/dt + T =Tb
The initial temperature of the object is 70 ̊F and the bath temperature is 170 ̊F
Report the temperature after 10, 20, and 40 seconds
How long does it take for the object to reach 160 ̊F? (Give answer to one decimal place.)
Plot the function for T(t) for the first 40 seconds. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 180 ̊C.
Include a grid, title, and axis labels.
