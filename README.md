# Change-in-Temperature-Application
The rate of change in the temperature of an object, 𝑑T/dt , is directly proportional to the difference between its temperature, T, and the ambient temperature, T 0
# Rc Circuit Application 
The equation for the voltage, V, across the capacitor of an RC circuit is RC dV/dT + V= Va
